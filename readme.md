To create this map, I began by making a list of the locations written in [Visit Raleigh's daytrip outline](https://www.visitraleigh.com/plan-a-trip/itineraries/one-day-tour-of-raleigh/). I created a route by choosing the locations in Google Maps and uploaded the result to [Maps to GPX] (https://mapstogpx.com/). Then, I created a GeoJSON using [GeoJSON.io](https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20). I used Leaflet extensions in VS Code to create the route, popups, and webpage.

To interact with the map, zoom with either the side buttons or your mouse. Click on each marker to view descriptive text about the location.
